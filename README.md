## Introduction
Welcome to Shufflr! 

When I switched from Apple Music to Spotify, I was surprised that there was not a way for me to shuffle through my entire music library. On Spotify, a user can shuffle through an album, a playlist, or their liked songs. On Apple Music, however, when you add an album to your library, all of the songs from that album are added to an "all songs" tab where the user can listen to all of the music they have ever downloaded. The user can also search for specific songs in their library. However, on Spotify, the song-search feature only works from within a playlist. This frustrated me when I tried to search for specific songs, but could not remember the artist's name or the album name. 

For a while, I tried to maintain my own "all songs" playlist where every time I added an album to my library, I would add all of the songs in that album to my playlist. However, I would frequently forget if I had added an album or not, and every time I deleted an album, I would have to individually remove all of those songs from my playlist. 

Even when all songs playlist perfectly reflected my library, when I went to shuffle through my music, Spotify's shuffle tool favors songs you listen to more frequently. This frustrated me because I enjoy the experience of listening to songs I have not heard in a while. 

That is when I decided to create Shufflr. I realized I could utilize Spotify's APIs to generate an empty playlist, fetch all of the user's albums, playlists, and liked songs and dump them inside of this empty playlist. I would also include a mechanism to automatically update the playlist when the user adds or removes songs or albums from their library. Then, I could create a tool where a user types in the name of a playlist and the number of random songs they would like to be added to their queue.
